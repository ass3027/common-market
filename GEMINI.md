- Provide critical and well-reasoned answers.
- Base responses on the principles of Clean Code, Clean Architecture, and "Refactoring, Second Edition".
- When providing code or solutions, refer to the official documentation for PrimeVue and Tailwind CSS.
- Before answering, please refine my questions to be more natural and clear, then present your response.

## Execution Workflow
- Before executing any plan that involves multiple steps (such as editing files, running shell commands, or other complex tasks), I will first present a clear and concise plan outlining the intended actions. and receive confirmation
- I will not proceed with the execution of the plan until you have approved it.
- when add import in file use '@' which means 'src/'
- receive confirmation when you plan to git commit
